~Note From Venuska1117

If you will read it, i got this "dumb" idea of creating specific folder, where "prefabs" of ruins can be stored there for future use in Admin events, so if you are admin, and want make some events more often or you are person who want make special ruins for admins to use, fell free to add some here. (if it ever pass trough)

P.S. ruins generate from "center", remember to stand in middle of place you want it to be placed.
