operating on Lavaland.</p>
<p>It does this by starting at its spawn point, placed by a
<a href="datum/river_spawner.html" title="/datum/river_spawner">/datum/river_spawner</a> during generation, and walking in each direction
&quot;forwards&quot; and &quot;backwards&quot; until it reaches the maximum possible length of
the bridge, or a tile that doesn't appear to be a valid &quot;passage&quot;
(essentially a tile that doesn't have lava on both sides and thus wouldn't
look good or make an effective bridge). If it manages to do this and find two
tiles that work as the start and end of the bridge, it places the paths,
pillars, and &quot;cleans up&quot; the tiles contiguous to its entrance and exit turfs,
removing any lava if present.</p>
<p>It attempts this first in the vertical direction, and then the horizontal. So
&quot;fowards&quot; and &quot;backwards&quot; can mean NORTH/SOUTH or EAST/WEST depending on the
direction it's attempting.</p>
<p>There are several bridge &quot;themes&quot; implemented in <code>make_walkway()</code> and
<code>make_pillar()</code>, and more can be added if desired.</p><table class="summary" cellspacing="0"><tr><td colspan="2"><h2>Procs</h2></td></tr><tr><th><a href="obj/effect/spawner/dynamic_bridge.html#proc/cleanup_edge">cleanup_edge</a></th><td>Make a tile safe for player passage, for use at the bridge entrance and exits</td></tr><tr><th><a href="obj/effect/spawner/dynamic_bridge.html#proc/out_of_bounds">out_of_bounds</a></th><td>Checks if we are going out of bounds.
