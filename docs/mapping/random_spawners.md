Random spawners are an organized tool primarily for mapping to enhance
replayability. The spawners can create objects, effects, and structures with
different tweakable settings to get the desired outcome. You can make a spawner
determine direction, rarity, number of items to spawn, pixel spacing between
items, and even spread it over a large tile radius. This lets you control the
atmosphere of a location. You could for instance spawn different piles of trash
in maint or spawn decoration items for a room to give it more randomized flavor.
The choice is yours!

## Variables

The following variables are defined in
`code/game/objects/effects/spawners/random/random_spawner.dm` that control how a
spawner works.

| Var                    | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loot`                 | A list of possible items to spawn e.g. `list(/obj/item, /obj/structure, /obj/effect)`                    |
| `loot_type_path`       | This combines the subtypes **and** type list with the loot list.                                         |
| `loot_subtype_path`    | This combines **only** the subtypes (excludes the `loot_subtype_path`) with the loot list.               |
| `spawn_loot_count`     | How many items will be spawned.                                                                          |
| `spawn_loot_double`    | If the same item can be spawned twice from the loot list.                                                |
| `spawn_loot_split`     | Whether the items should have staggered pixel offsets. This overrides `pixel_x/y` on the spawner itself. |
| `spawn_all_loot`       | Whether the spawner should spawn all the loot in the list (ignores `spawn_loot_count`).                  |
| `spawn_loot_chance`    | The chance for the spawner to create loot (ignores `spawn_loot_count`).                                  |
| `spawn_scatter_radius` | Determines how big of a range (in tiles) we should scatter things in.                                    |

These variables are set to the following default values for the base object that
all objects inherit from:

```dm
	/// these three loot values are all empty
	var/list/loot
	var/loot_type_path
	var/loot_subtype_path

	var/spawn_loot_count = 1 // by default one item will be selected from the loot list
	var/spawn_loot_double = TRUE // by default duplicate items CAN be spawned from the loot list
	var/spawn_loot_split = FALSE // by default items will NOT spread out on the same tile
	var/spawn_all_loot = FALSE // by default the spawner will only spawn the number of items set in spawn_loot_count
	var/spawn_loot_chance = 100 // by default the spawner has a 100% chance to spawn the item(s)
	var/spawn_scatter_radius = 0 // by default the spawner will spawn the items ONLY on the tile it is on
```

However there are some categories that overwrite these default values so pay
attention to the folder or category you group your spawner in. For instance the
`obj/effect/spawner/random/techstorage` category overwrites the `spawn_all_loot`
and the `spawn_loot_split` variables.

```dm
/obj/effect/spawner/random/research
	name = "generic research item spawner"
	spawn_loot_split = TRUE
	spawn_all_loot = TRUE
```

This means any spawner you create under the `tech_storage` subtype will also
have those variables set to that by default. This can be overridden quite easily
just be resetting the variables back to the normal state like so:

```dm
/obj/effect/spawner/random/research/data_disk
	name = "data disk spawner"
	spawn_all_loot = FALSE // now our loot won't all be spawned
	loot = list(
		/obj/item/disk/data = 49,
		/obj/item/disk/nuclear/fake/obvious = 1,
	)
```

## Template

All the random spawners follow the same template format to keep things
consistent and unison.

```dm
/obj/effect/spawner/random/INSERT_SPAWNER_GROUP/INSERT_SPAWNER_NAME
	name = "INSERT_SPAWNER_NAME spawner"
	loot = list(
		/obj/item/PATH/INSERT_OBJ_1,
		/obj/item/PATH/INSERT_OBJ_2,
		/obj/item/PATH/INSERT_OBJ_3,
	)
```

All the capitalized code is the parts where you are supposed to swap out with
your objects like so:

```dm
/obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
	name = "Tool spawner"
	loot = list(
		/obj/item/wrench,
		/obj/item/wirecutters,
		/obj/item/crowbar,
	)
```

Find the path to different objects and add them to the list but try to be
consistent with the types of the object and the spawner. For example, a tool
spawner shouldn't have a emag in the loot list!

## Probability

Be aware that the `loot` list uses a _weighted chance_ formula to determine
probability. So if there are no numbers set in the `loot` list then each object
defaults to 1 and has the same probability to be selected. For our above example
for the `/obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools` spawner, each item has a
1/3 chance to be spawned. But if we rearranged the values to this:

```dm
/obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
	name = "Tool spawner"
	loot = list(
		/obj/item/wrench = 2,
		/obj/item/wirecutters = 1,
		/obj/item/crowbar = 1,
	)
```

Then now `wrench` has a 50% chance of being spawned (2/4), `wirecutters` has a
25% chance of being spawned (1/4), and `crowbar` also has a 25% chance of being
spawned (1/4). If we add another item into the mix then we get the following:

```dm
/obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
	name = "Tool spawner"
	loot = list(
		/obj/item/wrench = 2,
		/obj/item/wirecutters = 1,
		/obj/item/crowbar = 1,
		/obj/item/weldingtool = 1,
	)
```

`wrench` is 40% (2/5), `wirecutters` is 20% (1/5), `crowbar` is 20% (1/5), and
`weldingtool` is 20% (1/5). A weighted list has the advantage of not needing to
update every item in the list when adding a new item. If the list was based on a
straight percent values, then each new item would require to manually go and
edit _all_ the items in the list. For big lists that would become very tedious.
This is why we use weighted lists to determine probability!

## Style

Here are some simple guidelines that you should stick to when making a new
spawner:

### If all items have the same chance, do not specify weights

Do not put `/obj/item = 1` unless other items have different spawn chances.

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/wrench = 2,
    		/obj/item/wirecutters = 1,
    		/obj/item/crowbar = 1,
    		/obj/item/weldingtool = 1,
    	)
    ```

    or:

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/wrench,
    		/obj/item/wirecutters,
    		/obj/item/crowbar,
    		/obj/item/weldingtool,
    	)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/wrench = 1,
    		/obj/item/wirecutters = 1,
    		/obj/item/crowbar = 1,
    		/obj/item/weldingtool = 1,
    	)
    ```

### Sort the list from highest probability to lowest

Sort from top to bottom. The rarest items for your spawner should be at the
bottom of the list.

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/contraband/armory
    	name = "armory loot spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol = 8,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/shotgun/automatic/combat = 5,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/syndie_kit/throwing_weapons = 3,
    		/obj/item/grenade/clusterbuster/teargas = 2,
    		/obj/item/grenade/clusterbuster = 2,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol/deagle = 1,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/revolver/mateba = 1,
    	)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/contraband/armory
    	name = "armory loot spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/storage/box/syndie_kit/throwing_weapons = 3,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol = 8,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/revolver/mateba = 1,
    		/obj/item/grenade/clusterbuster/teargas = 2,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol/deagle = 1,
    		/obj/item/grenade/clusterbuster = 2,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/shotgun/automatic/combat = 5,
    	)
    ```

### Always put the `loot` list at the bottom of your spawner

This is just to keep things organized.

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/food_or_drink/donkpockets
    	name = "donk pocket box spawner"
    	spawn_loot_double = FALSE
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketspicy,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketteriyaki,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketpizza,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketberry,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpockethonk,
    	)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/food_or_drink/donkpockets
    	name = "donk pocket box spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketspicy,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketteriyaki,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketpizza,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpocketberry,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/donkpockets/donkpockethonk,
    	)
    	spawn_loot_double = FALSE
    ```

### Always put a comma at the last item in the `loot` list

This will make it easier for people to add items to your spawner later without
getting frustrating code errors.

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/wrench,
    		/obj/item/wirecutters,
    		/obj/item/crowbar,
    	)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/wrench,
    		/obj/item/wirecutters,
    		/obj/item/crowbar // <-- missing comma
    	)
    ```

### Keep the same tab formatting for the `loot` list (unless there is only one item)

Again, this is just good code organization. If there is only one item, then
encase that item in `loot = list(item)`.

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/wrench,
    		/obj/item/wirecutters,
    		/obj/item/crowbar,
    	)
    ```

    or

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/structure/crate_abandoned
    	icon = 'icons/effects/landmarks_static.dmi'
    	icon_state = "loot_site"
    	spawn_loot_chance = 20
    	loot = list(/obj/structure/closet/crate/secure/loot)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(
    	/obj/item/wrench,
    	/obj/item/wirecutters,
    	/obj/item/crowbar,
    	)
    ```

    or

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/engineering/tools
    	name = "Tool spawner"
    	loot = list(/obj/item/wrench,
    		/obj/item/wirecutters,
    		/obj/item/crowbar,
    	)
    ```

### Try to keep the total combined weight of your `loot` list to sane values (Aim for 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100)

This makes the math probability easier for people to calculate (this is
recommended, but not always possible).

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/trash/cigbutt
    	name = "cigarette butt spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/cigbutt = 65,
    		/obj/item/cigbutt/roach = 20,
    		/obj/item/cigbutt/cigarbutt = 15,
    	)
    ```

    Also good:

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/trash/botanical_waste
    	name = "botanical waste spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/grown/bananapeel = 6,
    		/obj/item/grown/corncob = 3,
    		/obj/item/food/grown/bungopit = 1,
    	)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/entertainment/money_large
    	name = "large money spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c1 = 521,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c10 = 378,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c20 = 212,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c50 = 205,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c100 = 71,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c200 = 60,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c500 = 57,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c1000 = 41,
    		/obj/item/stack/spacecash/c10000 = 12,
    	)
    ```

### Do not put empty items in the loot list

Instead use the `spawn_loot_chance` var to control the chance for the spawner to
spawn nothing.

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/structure/crate_abandoned
    	name = "locked crate spawner"
    	spawn_loot_chance = 20
    	loot = list(/obj/structure/closet/crate/secure/loot)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/lootdrop/crate_spawner
    	name = "lootcrate spawner"
    	loot = list(
    		"" = 80
    		/obj/structure/closet/crate/secure/loot = 20,
    	)
    ```

### Avoid making a spawner that is a duplicate

We don't want copy-cat spawners that are almost identical. Instead merge
spawners together if possible.

!!! success "Good"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/random/contraband/armory
    	name = "armory loot spawner"
    	icon_state = "pistol"
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol = 8,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/shotgun/automatic/combat = 5,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/syndie_kit/throwing_weapons = 3,
    		/obj/item/grenade/clusterbuster/teargas = 2,
    		/obj/item/grenade/clusterbuster = 2,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol/deagle,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/revolver/mateba,
    	)
    ```

!!! failure "Bad"

    ```dm
    /obj/effect/spawner/lootdrop/armory_contraband
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol = 8,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/shotgun/automatic/combat = 5,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol/deagle,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/revolver/mateba
    	)

    /obj/effect/spawner/lootdrop/armory_contraband/metastation
    	loot = list(
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol = 8,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/shotgun/automatic/combat = 5,
    		/obj/item/storage/box/syndie_kit/throwing_weapons = 3,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/automatic/pistol/deagle,
    		/obj/item/gun/ballistic/revolver/mateba
    	)
    ```
