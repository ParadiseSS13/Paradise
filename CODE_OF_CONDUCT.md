# Important

The Paradise GitHub is not exempt from Paradise Station community and server rules, especially rules 0, 1, and 4. An inability to abide by the rules on the GitHub will result in disciplinary action up to, or including, a repository ban.

## General Expectations

### PR Discussion

Comments on Pull Requests should remain relevant to the PR in question and not derail discussions.

Under no circumstances are users to be attacked for their ideas or contributions. While constructive criticism is encouraged, toxicity or general mean-spirited behaviour will not be tolerated. All participants on a given PR or issue are expected to be civil. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action.

"Merge-nagging" or similar behaviour is not acceptable. Comments of this nature will result in warnings or an outright ban from the repository depending on general behaviour.

If you exhibit behaviour that's considered to be a net-negative to the community (offensive commentary, repeat violations, constant nagging, personal attacks, etc.), you may be banned from other Paradise services (Discord, forums, server, wiki, etc.)

Headcoders reserve the right to permanently revoke access from the repository if your behaviour is considered to be a net negative.

### PR Approval/Objection Info

Headcoders (who will take into account the votes from both the Design and Balance teams) have the final say on Pull Requests. While thumbsup/thumbsdown reaction ratios are generally taken into account, they do not dictate whether or not a PR will be merged.

After a twenty four hour minimum waiting period, Pull Requests can be merged once they receive approval from the relevant team. An exception is made for refactors and fixes, which may be merged by any member with commit access' discretion with no waiting period.

While normally provided, Design and Balance team members are not obligated to publicly state their objections to a Pull Request. Attacking or berating either of these roles over an objection will not be tolerated. Additionally, whining over the closure of a PR, the existence of an objection, or similar behaviour, will not be tolerated.

Headcoders may close your PR at their discretion if your PR history has little focus on improving repo maintainability (ie: making nothing but 20 balance or feature PRs). Likewise, balance PRs may be closed if the PR author has little-to-no time played on the server. This is to ensure balance changes are made by people actually in-touch with the server atmosphere.

### PR Expectations

All Pull Requests are expected to be tested prior to submission. If a submitted Pull Request fails to pass CI checks, the likelihood of it being merged will be significantly lower. If you can't take the time to compile/test your Pull Request, do not expect a warm reception.

It is expected that contributors discuss larger changes on the forums or repository discussion tab prior to starting work on a Pull Request. The amount of time spent on any given Pull Request is not relevant. Repo staff are not responsible for contributors wasting their time creating features nobody asked for. Be sure to inform the corresponding teams about the forum post or discussion.

In addition, discussing any change with the relevant teams is strongly advised. For large changes, changes which have a lot of impact (balance or design), species changes (however minor), or other changes that might be controversial, you should always discuss this with the relevant teams. Failure to do so might result in your PR being closed.

Barring highly specific circumstances (such as single line changes, submissions from advanced users, or changes to repo documentation), we will not accept Pull Requests utilising the web editor.

Pull Requests regarding heavy-handed nerfs, particularly immediately after said mechanic was used, will be tagged with `I ded pls nerf`. A bad experience with a particular mechanic is not a justification for nerfing it.

Reactionary revert PRs are not tolerated under any circumstances. Posting a revert immediately after a Pull Request is merged will result in a repoban.
