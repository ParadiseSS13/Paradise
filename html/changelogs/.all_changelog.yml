      grenades (2 N2O grenades, 8 TC, available to all agents), and Plasma Fire grenades

      using a plasma fire grenade to cause massive casualties/damage.

      and muted for 10 seconds without any delay.
  - rscadd: Added victory message to the End Round messages in the Shadowlings Rounds
  - tweak: Shadowling Destroy Engines ability reworked. You now need to sacrifice

      from laying brown spider eggs.
  - tweak: Admins are now able to spawn a queen of terror in a room without a vent.
      Previously, queens would not allow this. Now, this just results in an alert
      to admins (since its probably a mistake) and deactivates the mob AI (but leaves
      it available for player control).
  - rscadd: If there are player controlled terror spiders, admins using check antags
      panel will now be able to see eggs/spiderlings currently growing on the station.
      These counters only count eggs/spiderlings on station, and ignore fake spiderlings.
  - bugfix: 'Empress of terror''s ''erase brood'' ability no longer incorrectly causes
      mothers of terror to spawn spiderlings on death. sprite: Empress of terror now
      has its own sprite.'
  - tweak: White spider infections have been nerfed a bit. They no longer provide
      passive healing or increase infection progress while their host/victim is in
      crit. Also, the first spiderling to emerge from an infection can no longer be
      a green. Finally, the eggs now self-delete after the third spiderling emerges,
