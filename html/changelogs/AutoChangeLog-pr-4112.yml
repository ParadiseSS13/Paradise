changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added in Plasma Dust reagent, acquired by grinding plasma sheets; it's more toxic than regular plasma and generates plasma gas when spilled onto turfs."
  - tweak: "Slimecore reactions now require plasma dust as opposed to dispenser plasma"
  - rscadd: "Added in new Rainbow slime; inject with plasma dust to get a random colored slime. Acquire by having 100 mutation chance on a slime when it splits."
  - rscadd: "Monkey Recycler can produce different types of monkey cubes; change the cube type by using a multitool on the recycler"
  - tweak: "Epinephrine/plasma reagents changing mutation rate has been removed"
  - tweak: "Mutation chance is inherited from slime generation to slime generation as opposed to being purely random."
  - tweak: "New reactions added for red and blue extracts: red generates mutator, which increases mutation chance, and blue generates stabilizer, which decreases mutation chance."
  - tweak: "Slime glycerol reaction removed"
  - tweak: "Slime cells are now high capacity cells (more power than before)"
  - tweak: "extract enhancer increases the slime core usage by 1 as oppose to setting it to three"
  - tweak: "slime enhancer increases slime cores by 1 as opposed to setting the core amount to 3"
  - tweak: "Chill reaction lowers body temperature slightly more so it doesn't just wear off instantly"
  - tweak: "Reduces Xenobio plasma sheets from 8 to 3 and removes that pesky boombox"
  - bugfix: "Processors no longer produce 1 more slime core than intended"
  - bugfix: "Less blank/spriteless/empty foods from the silver core reaction"
  - tweak: "Virology mix reactions now use plasma dust as opposed to plasma"
