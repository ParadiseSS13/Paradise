  - tweak: "Mech-mounted teleporters are no longer massively overpowered. They now consume a huge amount of energy to use, to the point that crew mechs with them can only use them a few times. They can no longer be spammed. Dark Gygax mechs used by nuclear operatives get a better version of the teleporter, which has around 40 uses, and is more precise."
