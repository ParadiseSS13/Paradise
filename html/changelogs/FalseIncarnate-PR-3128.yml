# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Plants will now die of old age when they surpass 5 times their TRAIT_MATURATION value. This means a plant with TRAIT_MATURATION 5 will begin dying when it turns 26."
  - tweak: "Returned the chances for weeds to grow in a tray to what they were before PR #980. (6% if there is no seed, 3% otherwise)"
  - tweak: "Increased the chances of pests growing in a tray very slightly, and bumped up the amount that they increase. (5% chance to increase by 0.5)"
