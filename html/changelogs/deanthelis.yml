# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added the Clown Piano to the game. Instead of a 50/50 chance of the Bar piano being a Space Piano or a Space Minimoog, it is now a 50% chance of a Space Minimoog, and a 25% chance of a Space Piano or Clown Piano. It is functionally identical for the player when creating songs."
  - soundadd: "Added a set of sounds, using the existing piano sounds as a template, for the clown piano to use. Yes, it is bike horns. A full eight octaves of bike horns."
  - imageadd: "Added the Clown Piano and Broken Clown Piano sprites, which is an unholy abomination and should probably be replaced by someone who can do sprite art properly."
