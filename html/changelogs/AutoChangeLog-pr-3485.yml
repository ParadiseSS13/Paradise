changes: 
  - tweak: "People with borers cannot commit suicide - this applies to a controlling borer, too."
  - tweak: "Borers can no longer overdose their hosts."
  - tweak: "Borers can now inject Saline-Glucose, Spaceacillin, Hydrocodone, Mitocholide, Salbutamol, Capulettium+, and Charcoal. Styptic was removed, as it's pathetic at healing when directly injected. Salicyclic acid was removed too, as its functionality is duplicated by both hydrocodone and saline-glucose."
