changes: 
  - tweak: "Non-respawnable ghosts will no longer qualify for mid-round rejoining (event antags, golems, posibrains, etc). Drones, PAIs, and ERTs are exceptions to this."
  - tweak: "Cryodorms will no longer produce respawnable ghosts for the first 30 minutes of the round."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the spooky arrival shuttle. Cryo'd ghosts will now appear above their cryo pod, in the spooky cryodorms."
  - tweak: "Cryodorms will now despawn you 90% faster if you willingly enter one."
  - tweak: "Suiciding in the first 30 minutes of a round will no longer allow you to ghost and be respawnable."
  - tweak: "Becoming a non-respawnable ghost lasts the entire round, even if you ghost in a respawnable manner later on."
  - tweak: "You can no longer spam pinging posibrains, and cannot ping them at all if you cannot volunteer for one."
