changes: 
  - rscadd: "Mining drones will now automatically collect sand lying around"
  - bugfix: "RIPLEYs can now drill asteroid turfs for sand"
  - rscadd: "You can now load exosuit fuel generators with items containing their material - this means you can fuel yourself off of ores, but this will be highly inefficient and cost you mining points later on, as you can't take fuel back out."
  - rscadd: "You can now load the fuel generators from an ore box."
  - tweak: "The plasma generator now produces 3x as much power from the same amount of fuel - this lets it even remotely compete with the uranium generator."
