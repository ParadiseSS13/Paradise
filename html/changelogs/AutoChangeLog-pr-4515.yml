changes: 
  - rscdel: "Old gun code is now gone."
  - rscadd: "Ports the vast majority of TG's gun code and their guns (any previously unavailable guns, and newly-added guns will remain unavailable to players). Expect some changes that might not be listed here due to the sheer scope of this refactor."
  - rscadd: "Probably some new bugs."
  - bugfix: "A lot of old gun bugs."
  - rscadd: "Mouth suiciding with a gun no longer instantly kills you, you fire the gun at yourself at 5x damage (assuming it even did damage to begin with)."
  - tweak: "Mouth suicide shooting does not work on harm intent."
  - tweak: "You can now bash people with guns while on harm intent instead of shooting them point-blank."
  - rscadd: "You can now mouth suicide other people, doing so still takes the full 12 seconds to mouth suicide, but has the same 5x damage multiplier."
  - tweak: "Vox spike throwers are real guns that fire spike bullets now, instead of just being fake guns that threw spikes. They do 25 damage per hit, have 30 armor piercing, cause a 1 second stun (not the kind that drops you to the floor), and cause some bleeding. They have 2 round burst fire as well, and have 10 shots per clip. A new should should recharge every 20 or so seconds."
  - tweak: "Xray lasers now have a maximum range of 15 tiles."
  - bugfix: "Zoomed guns now actually fire accurately while zoomed."
  - rscadd: "Using Suicide with guns now actually does gun-like things."
  - tweak: "The clown no longer deletes guns if he fucks up with them due to being clumsy."
  - bugfix: "Emitters no longer become inaccurate over long ranges."
  - tweak: "Power gloves now override middle-click and alt-click when worn."
  - tweak: "Power gloves give a notification when worn."
  - tweak: "Power gloves now have special examine text when examined by an antagonist."
  - tweak: "Proto SMGs now only have a 21 shot clip."
