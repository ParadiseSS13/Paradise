changes: 
  - bugfix: "Wizards now can't teleport to other antag spawn points."
  - bugfix: "Removes an extruding pixel from the left-facing IPC glider monitor sprite."
  - tweak: "Ragin' Mages now spawn every 7 minutes, instead of 5. Admins can further adjust this by modifying the 'delay_per_mage' variable."
  - bugfix: "Ragin' Mages are now made with 100% less in-use souls (Apprentices won't have their consciousness yoinked)."
  - tweak: "It takes half an hour for the REAL chaos of ragin' mages to start, for at least a semblance of normality."
