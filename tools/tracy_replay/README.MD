# Info

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

The python script in this directory has been deprecated in favour of [https://github.com/AffectedArc07/ParaTracyReplay](https://github.com/AffectedArc07/ParaTracyReplay). It runs much faster and doesn't require you compiling a snowflake version of pylz4.

The notes below are kept for reference sake.

## Old script notes

This directory contains the `replay.py` script. This is used to "replay" custom `.utracy` files generated by the production server.

`BYOND-Tracy` profiles can use excessive amounts of RAM, upwards of 48GB in a single process if captured normally at runtime. This is not viable for the production server, so they are written as a custom flatfile inside of `data/profiler/`. These need to be read into tracy over the "network" (localhost) via `Tracy.exe` or `capture.exe`. You will need >48GB of RAM for this process. I am not joking.

The version of `replay.py` in this folder is compatible with the protocol of `Tracy 0.8.2`. Newer versions will not work. It requires the `lz4` python module with the streams extension. This requires manually downloading, building and installing the `python-lz4/python-lz4` repo and building with `PYLZ4_EXPERIMENTAL=TRUE` as an environment variable.
