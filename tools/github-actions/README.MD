# GitHub Actions Scripts

This folder contains all the script and tools required for GitHub actions. If you add something to this directory, **PLEASE** document it in here

- `nanomap-renderer` - A linux application to render NanoMap images of the ingame maps automatically. (a.k.a. SpacemanDMM, with modified source. Source [here](https://github.com/Toby222/SpacemanDMM))
- `nanomap-renderer-invoker.sh` - A script which invokes the render tool and clones the maps to the correct directory
