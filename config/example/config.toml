# Paradise SS13 Config System
# This used to be 10+ different text files, now its all condensed into one toml file with sections and proper values
# This is serialized to json on world load by RUSTG, and then handled inside BYOND
# Editing this in an IDE such as VSCode is highly recommended so you can lint for errors
# Commenting out any value will make it use the game default (likely null)
# If you add new sections, keep them alphabetical
# Please be careful editing this, as you can break it all if youre not careful. -aa07
