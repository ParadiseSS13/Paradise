### MOB MOVEMENT ###
## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server. To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame. Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.
## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game. To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied.
RUN_SPEED 1
WALK_SPEED 4

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 1.5
ROBOT_DELAY 1.5
MONKEY_DELAY 1.5
ALIEN_DELAY 1.5
SLIME_DELAY 1.5
ANIMAL_DELAY 2.5

## Comment for "normal" explosions, which ignore obstacles

### Configure the bomb cap
## This caps all explosions to the specified range. Used for both balance reasons and to prevent overloading the server and lagging the game out.
## This is given as the 3rd number(light damage) in the standard (1,2,3) explosion notation. The other numbers are derived by dividing by 2 and 4.
## eg: If you give the number 20. The bomb cap will be 5,10,20.
## Can be any number between 4 and 128, some examples are provided below.

## Default (3,7,14)
#BOMBCAP 14
## One 'step' up (5,10,20) (recommended if you enable REACTIONARY_EXPLOSIONS above)
BOMBCAP 20
## LagHell (7,14,28)
#BOMBCAP 28

### ROUNDSTART SILICON LAWS ###
## This controls what the AI's laws are at the start of the round.
## Set to 0/commented for "off", silicons will just start with Crewsimov.
## Set to 1 for "random", silicons will start with a random lawset picked from (at the time of writing): Nanotrasen Default, P.A.L.A.D.I.N., Corporate, Robop and Crewsimov. More can be added by changing the law datum "default" variable in ai_laws.dm.

LAVALAND_BUDGET 60

## Cube monkey limit
