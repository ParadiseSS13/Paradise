# ADMIN RANK DEFINES                                                                   #
# The format of this is very simple. Rank name goes first.                             #
# Rank is CASE-SENSITIVE, all punctuation will be stripped so spaces don't matter.     #
# Each rank is then followed by keywords with the prefix "+".                          #
# These keywords represent groups of verbs and abilities which are given to that rank. #
# +@ (or +prev) is a special shorthand which adds all the rights of the rank above it. #
# Ranks with no keywords will just be given the most basic verbs and abilities  	   #

# KEYWORDS:
# +MENTOR = Access only to the Question's Ahelp and has little way of metagaming the game.

# +BUILD (or +BUILDMODE) = the ability to use buildmode
# +SERVER = higher-risk admin verbs and abilities, such as those which affect the server configuration.
# +DEBUG = debug tools used for diagnosing and fixing problems. It's useful to give this to coders so they can investigate problems on a live server.
