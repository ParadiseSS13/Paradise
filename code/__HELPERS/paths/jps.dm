 * If we're doing a normal lateral scan, we already have a parent node supplied, so we just create the new node and immediately insert it into the heap, ezpz.
 * If we're part of a subscan, we still need for the diagonal scan to generate a parent node, so we return a node datum with just the turf and let the diag scan

 * * heading: What direction are we going in? Obviously, should be cardinal
 * * parent_node: Only given for normal lateral scans, if we don't have one, we're a diagonal subscan.
