/*
	output_atoms	(list of atoms)			The destination(s) for the sounds

	mid_sounds		(list or soundfile)		Since this can be either a list or a single soundfile you can have random sounds. May contain further lists but must contain a soundfile at the end.
	mid_length		(num)					The length to wait between playing mid_sounds

	start_sound		(soundfile)				Played before starting the mid_sounds loop
	start_length	(num)					How long to wait before starting the main loop after playing start_sound

	end_sound		(soundfile)				The sound played after the main loop has concluded

	chance			(num)					Chance per loop to play a mid_sound
	volume			(num)					Sound output volume
	muted			(bool)					Private. Used to stop the sound loop.
	max_loops		(num)					The max amount of loops to run for.
	direct			(bool)					If true plays directly to provided atoms instead of from them
