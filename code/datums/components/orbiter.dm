/**
 * Code to handle atoms orbiting other atoms, following them as they move.
 * The basic logic is simple. We register a signal, COMSIG_MOVABLE_MOVED onto orbited atoms.
 * 	When the orbited atom moves, any ghosts orbiting them are moved to their turf.
 * We also register a MOVED signal onto the ghosts to cancel their orbit if they move themselves.
 * Complexities come in for items within other items (such as the NAD in a box in a backpack on an assistant pretending to be the captain),
 * 	as items in containers do **not** fire COMSIG_MOVABLE_MOVED when their container moves.
 *
 * The signal logic for items in containers is as follows:
 * Assume 1 is some item (for example, the NAD) and 2 is a box.
 * When 1 is added to 2, we register the typical orbit COMSIG_MOVABLE_MOVED onto 2.
 * 	This in essence makes 2 the "leader", the atom that ghosts follow in movement.
 *  As 2 is moved around (say, dragged on the floor) ghosts will follow it.
 * We also register a new intermediate COMSIG_MOVABLE_MOVED signal onto 1 that tracks if 1 is moved.
 * 	Remember, this will only fire if 1 is moved around containers, since it's impossible for it to actually move on its own.
 * 	If 1 is moved out of 2, this signal makes 1 the new leader.
 * Lastly, we add a COMSIG_ATOM_EXITED to 2, which tracks if 1 is removed from 2.
 * 	This EXITED signal cleans up any orbiting signals on and above 2.
 * If 2 is added to another item, (say a backpack, 3)
 * 	3 becomes the new leader
 * 	2 becomes an intermediate
 * 	1 is unchanged (but still carries the orbiter datum)
 *
 *
 * You may be asking yourself: is this overengineered?
 * In part, yes. However, MOVED signals don't get fired for items in containers, so this is
 * 	really the next best way.
 * Also, is this really optimal?
 *	As much as it can be, I believe. This signal-shuffling will not happen for any item that is just moving from turf to turf,
 * 	which should apply to 95% of cases (read: ghosts orbiting mobs).
