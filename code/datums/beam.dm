/** # Beam Datum and Effect
 * **IF YOU ARE LAZY AND DO NOT WANT TO READ, GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE AND USE THAT PROC!**
 *
 * This is the beam datum! It's a really neat effect for the game in drawing a line from one atom to another.
 * It has two parts:
 * The datum itself which manages redrawing the beam to constantly keep it pointing from the origin to the target.
 * The effect which is what the beams are made out of. They're placed in a line from the origin to target, rotated towards the target and snipped off at the end.
 * These effects are kept in a list and constantly created and destroyed (hence the proc names draw and reset, reset destroying all effects and draw creating more.)
 *
 * You can add more special effects to the beam itself by changing what the drawn beam effects do. For example you can make a vine that pricks people by making the beam_type
 * include a crossed proc that damages the crosser. Examples in venus_human_trap.dm
