	This camera bug can access all default cameras on the station, along with the hidden cameras provided in this kit.<br>
	<br>
	The cameras in this kit have a sticky backside, allowing you to attach them to literally anything, even people.<br>
	<br>
	You may remove the cameras from said objects by grabbing them with an empty hand.<br>
	<br>
	You can view these hidden cameras by looking up "Hidden Camera" on your camera bug.<br>
	<br>
	Only the camera bug provided in this kit can see these hidden cameras.<br>
	<br>
	Other Camera bugs cannot see your hidden cameras.<br>
	<br>
	There is no other way to get these hidden cameras, so make sure to not lose them!<br>"}
