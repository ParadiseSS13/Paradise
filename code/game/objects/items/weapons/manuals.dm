/**
  * # MANUALS (BOOKS)
  *
  * These are "programmatic books," that is books that are hard-coded into the game. Just for the sake of maintainability, keep
  * information subject to change (as in likely to change SOON) out of the non-wiki manuals as they require PRs to change
  * and it is not an author's responsbility to update manuals if they change a mechanic/recipe/feature referenced in one of them
  * Don't worry about adding them to the library, as long as they're one of these types it is automatically added.
  *
  * Longer Guides should really be a '/obj/item/book/manual/wiki' type book and be tethered to a wiki page, this is because wiki pages
  * outside of SOP & Space Law can be very easily changed and do not require going through the Pull Request process. The benefits of
  * these are that they can be illustrated, filled with tables, and changed without affecting the codebase.
  *
  * However, contributors should avoid making every book/page tethered to a wiki page for a few reasons:
  * 1. many players who are likely just starting out would benefit from only getting a little bit of info to get started (think 5-10 bar recipes)
  * 2. Wiki pages are purposefully dry and to the point, manuals benefit from having flavor/personality to them to make them interesting to read ICly
  * 3. One can just open the damn wiki instead of reading a crusty-ass manual

			<h3>Detective Work</h3>
			Between your bouts of self-narration, and drinking whiskey on the rocks, you might get a case or two to solve.<br>
			To have the best chance to solve your case, follow these directions:
			<p>
			<ol>
			<li>Go to the crime scene. </li>
			<li>Take your scanner and scan EVERYTHING (Yes, the doors, the tables, even the dog.) </li>
			<li>Once you are reasonably certain you have every scrap of evidence you can use, find all possible entry points and scan them, too. </li>
			<li>Return to your office. </li>
			<li>Using your forensic scanning computer, scan your Scanner to upload all of your evidence into the database.</li>
			<li>Browse through the resulting dossiers, looking for the one that either has the most complete set of prints, or the most suspicious items handled. </li>
			<li>If you have 80% or more of the print (The print is displayed) go to step 10, otherwise continue to step 8.</li>
			<li>Look for clues from the suit fibres you found on your perp, and go about looking for more evidence with this new information, scanning as you go. </li>
			<li>Try to get a fingerprint card of your perp, as if used in the computer, the prints will be completed on their dossier.</li>
			<li>Assuming you have enough of a print to see it, grab the biggest complete piece of the print and search the security records for it. </li>
			<li>Since you now have both your dossier and the name of the person, print both out as evidence, and get security to nab your baddie.</li>
			<li>Give yourself a pat on the back and a bottle of the ships finest vodka, you did it!. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			It really is that easy! Good luck!

				<h1><a name="Forward"><u><b>HOW TO NOT SUCK QUITE SO HARD AT ATMOSPHERICS</b></u></a></h1><br>
				<i>Or: What the fuck does a "passive gate" do?</i><br><br>
				Alright. It has come to my attention that a variety of people are unsure of what a "pipe" is and what it does.
				Apparently there is an unnatural fear of these arcane devices and their "gases". Spooky, spooky. So,
				this will tell you what every device constructable by an ordinary pipe dispenser within atmospherics actually does.
				You are not going to learn what to do with them to be the super best person ever, or how to play guitar with passive gates,
				or something like that. Just what stuff does.<br><br>
				<h1><a name="Basic"><b>Basic Pipes</b></a></h1><br>
				<i>The boring ones.</i><br>
				Most ordinary pipes are pretty straightforward. They hold gas. If gas is moving in a direction for some reason, gas will flow in that direction.
				That's about it. Even so, here's all of your wonderful pipe options.<br>
				<li><i>Straight pipes:</i> They're pipes. One-meter sections. Straight line. Pretty simple. Just about every pipe and device is based around this
				standard one-meter size, so most things will take up as much space as one of these.</li>
				<li><i>Bent pipes:</i> Pipes with a 90 degree bend at the half-meter mark. My goodness.</li>
				<li><i>Pipe manifolds:</i> Pipes that are essentially a "T" shape, allowing you to connect three things at one point.</li>
				<li><i>4-way manifold:</i> A four-way junction.</li>
				<li><i>Pipe cap:</i> Caps off the end of a pipe. Open ends don't actually vent gas, because of the way the pipes are assembled, so, uh. Use them to decorate your house or something.</li>
				<li><i>Manual/Digital Valves:</i> A valve that will block off gas flow when turned. Manual valves can't be used by the AI or cyborgs because they don't have hands, but they can access digital valves.</li>
				<li><i>Manual/Digital T-Valves:</i> Like a straight valve, but at the center of a manifold instead of a straight pipe, allowing you to swap between two different pipe networks.</li><BR><BR>
				<h1><a name="Insulated"><b>Insulated Pipes</b></a></h1><br>
				<i>Special Public Service Announcement.</i><br>
				Our regular pipes are already insulated. These are completely worthless. Punch anyone who uses them.<br><br>
				<h1><a name="Devices"><b>Devices: </b></a></h1><br>
				<i>They actually do something.</i><br>
				This is usually where people get frightened, </font><font face="Verdana" color=black>afraid, and start calling on their gods and/or cowering in fear. Yes, I can see you doing that right now.
				Stop it. It's unbecoming. Most of these are fairly straightforward.<br>
				<li><i>Gas Pump:</i> Take a wild guess. It moves gas in the direction it's pointing (marked by the red line on one end). It moves it based on pressure, the maximum output being 4500 kPa (kilopascals).
				Ordinary atmospheric pressure, for comparison, is 101.3 kPa, and the minimum pressure of room-temperature pure oxygen needed to not suffocate in a matter of minutes is 16 kPa
				(though 18 is preferred using internals, for various reasons).</li>
				<li><i>Volume pump:</i> This pump goes based on volume, instead of pressure, and the possible maximum pressure it can create in the pipe on the receiving end is double the gas pump because of this,
				clocking in at an incredible 9000 kPa. If a pipe with this is destroyed or damaged, and this pressure of gas escapes, it can be incredibly dangerous depending on the size of the pipe filled.
				Don't hook this to the distribution loop, or you will make babies cry and the Chief Engineer brutally beat you.</li>
				<li><i>Passive gate:</i> This is essentially a cap on the pressure of gas allowed to flow in a specific direction.
				When turned on, instead of actively pumping gas, it measures the pressure flowing through it, and whatever pressure you set is the maximum: it'll cap after that.
				In addition, it only lets gas flow one way. As with pumps, the red handle on a passive gate indicates the direction the passive gate will output its gas when active.</li>
				<li><i>Unary vent:</i> The basic vent used in rooms. It pumps or siphons gas in or out of a room depending on the setting. Controlled by the room's air alarm system.</li>
				<li><i>Scrubber:</i> The other half of room equipment. Filters air and can suck it in entirely in what's called a "panic siphon". Activating a panic siphon without very good reason will kill someone. Don't do it.
				Scrubbers also have an extended mode that can be enabled to expand the range and increase the amount of gas being filtered.</li>
				<li><i>Passive Vent:</i> Passive vents are the lesser known cousin to Unary vents. Passive vents will exchange gas between the surrounding atmosphere and its connected pipe until the pressure between the two has reached an equilibrium.</li>
				<li><i>Meter:</i> A little box with some gauges and numbers. Fasten it to any pipe or manifold, and it'll read you the pressure in it. Very useful.</li>
				<li><i>Gas mixer:</i> Two sides are input, one side is output. Mixes the gases pumped into it at the ratio defined. The side perpendicular to the other two is "node 2", for reference.
				Can output this gas at pressures from 0-4500 kPa.</li>
				<li><i>Gas filter:</i> Essentially the opposite of a gas mixer. One side is input. The other two sides are output. The selected gas type will be filtered into the perpendicular output pipe,
				the rest will continue out the other side. Can also output from 0-4500 kPa.</li>
				<h1><a name="HES"><b>Heat Exchange Systems</b></a></h1><br>
				<i>Will not set you on fire.</i><br>
				These systems are used to transfer heat only between two pipes. They will not move gases or any other element, but will equalize the temperature (eventually). Note that because of how gases work (remember: pv=nRt),
				a higher temperature will raise pressure, and a lower one will lower temperature.<br>
				<li><i>Pipe:</i> This is a pipe that will exchange heat with the surrounding atmosphere. Place in a fire for superheating. Place in space for supercooling.</li>
				<li><i>Bent Pipe:</i> Take a wild guess.</li>
				<li><i>Junction:</i><i>Junction:</i>The point where you connect your normal pipes to heat exchange pipes. Not necessary for heat exchangers, but necessary for H/E pipes/bent pipes.</li>
				<li><i>Heat Exchanger:</i> These funky-looking bits attach to an open pipe end. Put another heat exchanger directly across from it, and you can transfer heat across two pipes without having to have the gases mix.
				This normally shouldn't exchange with the ambient air, despite being totally exposed. Just don't ask questions...</li><BR>
				<h1><a name="HES"><b>Final Checks</b></a></h1><br>
				That's about it for pipes. Remember to turn your magboots on and keep a fire extinguisher near. Go forth, armed with this knowledge, and try not to break, burn down, or kill anything. Please.</font>

				<h1><a name="Forward">EVA Gear and You: Not Spending All Day Inside</a></h1><BR>
				<I>Or: How not to suffocate because there's a hole in your shoes</I><BR><BR>
				EVA gear. Wonderful to use. It's useful for mining, engineering, and occasionally just surviving, if things are that bad. Most people have EVA training,
				but apparently there are some on a space station who don't. This guide should give you a basic idea of how to use this gear, safely. It's split into two sections:
				Civilian suits and hardsuits.<BR><BR>
				<h1><a name="Civilian">Civilian Suits</a></h1><BR>
				<I>The bulkiest things this side of Alpha Centauri</I><BR>
				These suits are the grey ones that are stored in EVA. They're the more simple to get on, but are also a lot bulkier, and provide less protection from environmental hazards such as radiaion or physical impact.
				As Medical, Engineering, Security, and Mining all have hardsuits of their own, these don't see much use, but knowing how to put them on is quite useful anyways.<BR><BR>
				First, take the suit. It should be in three pieces: A top, a bottom, </font><font face="Verdana" color=black>and a helmet. Put the bottom on first, shoes and the like will fit in it. If you have magnetic boots, however,
				put them on on top of the suit's feet. Next, get the top on, as you would a shirt. It can be somewhat awkward putting these pieces on, due to the makeup of the suit,
				but to an extent they will adjust to you. You can then find the snaps and seals around the waist, where the two pieces meet. Fasten these, and double-check their tightness.
				The red indicators around the waist of the lower half will turn green when this is done correctly. Next, put on whatever breathing apparatus you're using, be it a gas mask or a breath mask. Make sure the oxygen tube is fastened into it.
				Put on the helmet now, straight forward, and make sure the tube goes into the small opening specifically for internals. Again, fasten seals around the neck, a small indicator light in the inside of the helmet should go from red to off when all is fastened.
				There is a small slot on the side of the suit where an emergency oxygen tank or</font><font face="Verdana" color=black> extended emergency oxygen tank will fit,
				but it is reccomended to have a full-sized tank on your back for EVA.<BR><BR>
				<h1><a name="Hardsuit">Hardsuits</a></h1><BR>
				<I>Heavy, uncomfortable, still the best option.</I><BR>
				These suits come in Engineering, Mining, and the Armory. There's also a couple Medical Hardsuits in EVA. These provide a lot more protection than the standard suits.<BR><BR>
				Similarly to the other suits, these are split into three parts. Fastening the pant and top are mostly the same as the other spacesuits, with the exception that these are a bit heavier,
				though not as bulky. The helmet goes on differently, with the air tube feeing into the suit and out a hole near the left shoulder, while the helmet goes on turned ninety degrees counter-clockwise,
				and then is screwed in for one and a quarter full rotations clockwise, leaving the faceplate directly in front of you. There is a small button on the right side of the helmet that activates the helmet light.
				The tanks that fasten onto the side slot are emergency tanks, as</font><font face="Verdana" color=black> well as full-sized oxygen tanks, leaving your back free for a backpack or satchel.<BR><BR>
				<h1><a name="Final">FINAL CHECKS:</a></h1><BR>
				<li>Are all seals fastened correctly?</li>
				<li>Do you either have shoes on under the suit, or magnetic boots on over it?</li>
				<li>Do you have a mask on and internals on the suit or your back?</li>
				<li>Do you have a way to communicate with the station in case something goes wrong?</li>
				<li>Do you have a second person watching if this is a training session?</li><BR>
				If you don't have any further issues, go out and do whatever is necessary.</font>

				<h3>Singularity Safety in Special Circumstances</h3>

				<h4>Power outage</h4>

				A power problem has made the entire station loose power? Could be station-wide wiring problems or syndicate power sinks. In any case follow these steps:
				<p>
				<b>Step one:</b> <b><font color='red'>PANIC!</font></b><br>
				<b>Step two:</b> Get your ass over to engineering! <b>QUICKLY!!!</b><br>
				<b>Step three:</b> Get to the <b>Area Power Controller</b> which controls the power to the emitters.<br>
				<b>Step four:</b> Swipe it with your <b>ID card</b> - if it doesn't unlock, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step five:</b> Open the console and disengage the cover lock.<br>
				<b>Step six:</b> Pry open the APC with a <b>Crowbar.</b><br>
				<b>Step seven:</b> Take out the empty <b>power cell.</b><br>
				<b>Step eight:</b> Put in the new, <b>full power cell</b> - if you don't have one, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step nine:</b> Quickly put on a <b>Radiation suit.</b><br>
				<b>Step ten:</b> Check if the <b>singularity field generators</b> withstood the down-time - if they didn't, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step eleven:</b> Since disaster was averted you now have to ensure it doesn't repeat. If it was a powersink which caused it and if the engineering apc is wired to the same powernet, which the powersink is on, you have to remove the piece of wire which links the apc to the powernet. If it wasn't a powersink which caused it, then skip to step 14.<br>
				<b>Step twelve:</b> Grab your crowbar and pry away the tile closest to the APC.<br>
				<b>Step thirteen:</b> Use the wirecutters to cut the wire which is conecting the grid to the terminal. <br>
				<b>Step fourteen:</b> Go to the bar and tell the guys how you saved them all. Stop reading this guide here.<br>
				<b>Step fifteen:</b> <b>GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!!</b><br>

				<h3>How to Clone People</h3>
				Picture the scene: there's five corpses surrounding you, the Chief Medical Officer is yelling something \
				about terror spiders into their radio, and you only graduated medical school last week. What are you supposed to do? <br> \
				Well, Thinktronics Corporation is proud to present you the new and improved TTC-5601 cloning device - capable of \
				economically resuscitating even the most damaged of bodies. What follows is a guide on how to use this newer model \
				of cloning machine and where it differs from previous models.

				<ol>
					<li><a href='#1'>Preparation</a></li>
					<li><a href='#2'>Load into Cloning Scanner</a></li>
					<li><a href='#3'>Scan Patient</a></li>
					<li><a href='#4'>Configure Device</a></li>
					<li><a href='#5'>Clone</a></li>
					<li><a href='#6'>Finish Procedure</a></li>
				</ol>

				<a name='1'><h4>Step 1: Preparation</h4>
				Your patient must be dead to clone them (as of the Cloning Regulatory Act of 2533). Therefore, make sure that \
				they are deceased before proceeding, and ideally try to revive them via defibrillation! If that fails, however, \
				you should strip them of their equipment and check to make sure the cloning pod is loaded with, at least, 250 \
				biomass. <br>
				If your patient has a lot of damage, it'll take a lot of biomass to clone them! If you do not have ample biomass \
				or simply want to conserve it, try to tend to the cadaver's wounds before proceeding. In addition, fixing broken \
				bones and internal bleeds via cloning will consume Osseous Reagent and Sanguine Reagent respectively - these are \
				both much harder to replenish than biomass, so consider being polite to your chemists and fixing these via \
				surgery instead.

				<a name='2'><h4>Step 2: Load into Cloning Scanner</h4>
				After stripping your patient, load them into the cloning device's scanning machine, as you would with any other \
				device.

				<a name='3'><h4>Step 3: Scan Patient</h4>
				Access the cloning device's terminal, then navigate to the Damage Configuration menu and click 'scan.' If you see \
				'Scan Successful' - great! Move on to the next step. If not, the device will inform you about what went wrong with \
				the process. If it says it failed to sequence the patient's brain, try to scan them again in a few seconds. \

				<a name='4'><h4>Step 4: Configure Device</h4>
				This step is where the TTC-5601 cloning device diverges from its earlier models. Its advanced systems allow you to \
				conserve resources and elect to <i>not</i> fix certain damages, or elect to fix all damages - all on the fly! Keep \
				in mind that if you're short on resources, you'll <i>have</i> to leave some damages on the patient in order to clone \
				them. Once you're done tweaking settings, proceed to the next step.

				<a name='5'><h4>Step 5: Clone</h4>
				This is the simplest, but most important step. Simply press 'Clone' in the Damage Configuration menu, and the machine \
				will begin the process of cloning. The process is fully automatic, so feel free to take care of other chores in the \
				meanwhile - like moving the scanned cadaver to the morgue.

				<a name='6'><h4>Step 6: Finish Procedure</h4>
				After cloning, the patient may be disoriented - help them to get their bearings and put on the gear you stripped from \
				their previous body. In addition, make sure to fix any wounds you may have left to save resources before sending them off.

				<h1>Science For Dummies</h1>
				So you want to further SCIENCE? Good man/woman/thing! However, SCIENCE is a complicated process even though it's quite easy. For the most part, it's a three step process:
				<ol>
					<li> 1) Deconstruct items in the Destructive Analyzer to advance technology or improve the design.</li>
					<li> 2) Build unlocked designs in the Protolathe and Circuit Imprinter</li>
					<li> 3) Repeat!</li>
				</ol>

				Those are the basic steps to furthing science. What do you do science with, however? Well, you have four major tools: R&D Console, the Destructive Analyzer, the Protolathe, and the Circuit Imprinter.

				<h2>The R&D Console</h2>
				The R&D console is the cornerstone of any research lab. It is the central system from which the Destructive Analyzer, Protolathe, and Circuit Imprinter (your R&D systems) are controled. More on those systems in their own sections. On its own, the R&D console acts as a database for all your technological gains and new devices you discover. So long as the R&D console remains intact, you'll retain all that SCIENCE you've discovered. Protect it though, because if it gets damaged, you'll lose your data! In addition to this important purpose, the R&D console has a disk menu that lets you transfer data from the database onto disk or from the disk into the database. It also has a settings menu that lets you re-sync with nearby R&D devices (if they've become disconnected), lock the console from the unworthy, upload the data to all other R&D consoles in the network (all R&D consoles are networked by default), connect/disconnect from the network, and purge all data from the database.
				<b>NOTE:</b> The technology list screen, circuit imprinter, and protolathe menus are accessible by non-scientists. This is intended to allow 'public' systems for the plebians to utilize some new devices.

				<h2>Destructive Analyzer</h2>
				This is the source of all technology. Whenever you put a handheld object in it, it analyzes it and determines what sort of technological advancements you can discover from it. If the technology of the object is equal or higher then your current knowledge, you can destroy the object to further those sciences. Some devices (notably, some devices made from the protolathe and circuit imprinter) aren't 100% reliable when you first discover them. If these devices break down, you can put them into the Destructive Analyzer and improve their reliability rather then futher science. If their reliability is high enough ,it'll also advance their related technologies.

				<h2>Circuit Imprinter</h2>
				This machine, along with the Protolathe, is used to actually produce new devices. The Circuit Imprinter takes glass and various chemicals (depends on the design) to produce new circuit boards to build new machines or computers. It can even be used to print AI modules.

				<h2>Protolathe</h2>
				This machine is an advanced form of the Autolathe that produce non-circuit designs. Unlike the Autolathe, it can use processed metal, glass, solid plasma, silver, gold, and diamonds along with a variety of chemicals to produce devices. The downside is that, again, not all devices you make are 100% reliable when you first discover them.

				<h1>Reliability and You</h1>
				As it has been stated, many devices when they're first discovered do not have a 100% reliablity when you first discover them. Instead, the reliablity of the device is dependent upon a base reliability value, whatever improvements to the design you've discovered through the Destructive Analyzer, and any advancements you've made with the device's source technologies. To be able to improve the reliability of a device, you have to use the device until it breaks beyond repair. Once that happens, you can analyze it in a Destructive Analyzer. Once the device reachs a certain minimum reliability, you'll gain tech advancements from it.

				<h1>Building a Better Machine</h1>
				Many machines produces from circuit boards and inserted into a machine frame require a variety of parts to construct. These are parts like capacitors, batteries, matter bins, and so forth. As your knowledge of science improves, more advanced versions are unlocked. If you use these parts when constructing something, its attributes may be improved. For example, if you use an advanced matter bin when constructing an autolathe (rather then a regular one), it'll hold more materials. Experiment around with stock parts of various qualities to see how they affect the end results! Be warned, however: Tier 3 and higher stock parts don't have 100% reliability and their low reliability may affect the reliability of the end machine.

			Nuclear Explosives 101:<br>
			Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs.<br>
			Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Nanotrasen made Nuclear Device.<br>
			First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE.<br>
			Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place.<br>
			If this is done to unbolt it one must completely log in which at this time may not be possible.<br>
			To make the nuclear device functional:<br>
			<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
			<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
			<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into slot.</li>
			<li>Type numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided. Note: If you make a mistake press R to reset the device.
			<li>Press the E button to log onto the device.</li>
			You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation	remove the auth disk OR press the R on the keypad.<br>
			Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option.<br>
			Note: Nanotrasen is a pain in the neck.<br>
			Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
			Note: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br>
			So use the - - and + + to set a det time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes.<br>
			Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown.<br>
			Now remove the auth. disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
			Note: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br>
			Now before you remove the disk if you need to move the bomb you can:<br>
			Toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>
			Good luck. Remember the order:<br>
			<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br>
			Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Nanotrasen procedure is for the Captain to secure the nuclear authorisation disk.<br>
			Good luck!

				Why would you want to grow humans? Well I'm expecting most readers to be in the slave trade, but a few might actually
				want to revive fallen comrades. Growing pod people is easy, but prone to disaster.
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Find a dead person who is in need of cloning. </li>
				<li>Take a blood sample with a syringe. </li>
				<li>Inject a seed pack with the blood sample. </li>
				<li>Plant the seeds. </li>
				<li>Tend to the plants water and nutrition levels until it is time to harvest the cloned human.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!
