 * The C-Foam launcher from GTFO
 * Shoots a blob of goo. If it hits an airlock, it will get closed shut, and you will have to either destroy the goo by force, or weld it off. The RnD foam is instant, and the traitor version has a `do_after`
 * RnD printed needs canisters, while the traitor variant will slowly regenerate foam.
 * The traitor variant also slows down mobs if they are hit by the foam.
 * Overall, a good support tool designed to
