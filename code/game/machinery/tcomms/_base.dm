/*

	ParadiseSS13 Telecommunications System

	Rewritten from the ground up because I was totally unhappy with how laggy and complicated the current implementation was
	The system is made up of two objects. A main core and relays.

	The main core is basically the same as all of the machines from the previous implementation, apart from the relay
	The core handles recieving and sending messages, logging messages, the NTTC configuration, and serves as the linkage hub for relays

	Relays function much in the same way as the old ones. They just expand the reach of tcomms from one z-level to another.

	This file contains extra datums and helper procs which the system utilises.
	Unlike old telecomms, everything in here **should** be well documented. If not, feel free to add your own
