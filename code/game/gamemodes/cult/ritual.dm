	invoking it and choosing which talisman you desire, the paper will be converted, after some delay into a talisman.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Teleport</b></font><br>This rune is unique in that it requires a keyword before the scribing can begin. When invoked, it will find any other Teleport runes; \
	If any are found, the user can choose which rune to send to. Upon activation, the rune teleports everything above it to the selected rune.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Rite of Enlightenment</b></font><br>This rune is critical to the success of the cult. It will allow you to convert normal crew members into cultists. \
	To do this, simply place the crew member upon the rune and invoke it. This rune requires two invokers to use. If the target to be converted is mindshielded or a certain assignment, they will \
	be unable to be converted. People [ticker.mode.cultdat.entity_title3] wishes sacrificed will also be ineligible for conversion, and anyone with a shielding presence like the null rod will not be converted.<br> \
	Successful conversions will produce a tome for the new cultist.<br><br>"

	target cultists!). If this creature has a mind, a soulstone will be created and the creature's soul transported to it. Sacrificing the dead can be done alone, but sacrificing living crew <b>or your cult's target</b> will require 3 cultists. \
	Soulstones used on construct shells will move that soul into a powerful construct of your choice.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Rite of Resurrection</b></font><br>This rune requires two corpses. To perform the ritual, place the corpse you wish to revive onto \
	the rune and the offering body adjacent to it. When the rune is invoked, the body to be sacrificed will turn to dust, the life force flowing into the revival target. Assuming the target is not moved \

	rune is activated.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Astral Communion</b></font><br>This rune is perhaps the most ingenious rune that is usable by a single person. Upon invoking the rune, the \
	user's spirit will be ripped from their body. In this state, the user's physical body will be locked in place to the rune itself - any attempts to move it will result in the rune pulling it back. \
	The body will also take constant damage while in this form, and may even die. The user's spirit will contain their consciousness, and will allow them to freely wander the station as a ghost. This may \

	undo this effect and allow passage again.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Rite of Joined Souls</b></font><br>This rune allows the cult to free other cultists with ease. When invoked, it will allow the user to summon a single cultist to the rune from \

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Blood Boil</b></font><br>When invoked, this rune will do a massive amount of damage to all non-cultist viewers, but it will also emit a small explosion upon invocation. \

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Leeching</b></font><br>When invoked, this rune will transfer lifeforce from the victim to the invoker.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Rite of Spectral Manifestation</b></font><br>This rune allows you to summon spirits as humanoid fighters. When invoked, a spirit above the rune will be brought to life as a human, wearing nothing, that seeks only to serve you and [ticker.mode.cultdat.entity_title3]. \
	However, the spirit's link to reality is fragile - you must remain on top of the rune, and you will slowly take damage. Upon stepping off the rune, all summoned spirits will dissipate, dropping their items to the ground. You may manifest \
	multiple spirits with one rune, but you will rapidly take damage in doing so.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b><i>Ritual of Dimensional Rending</i></b></font><br><b>This rune is necessary to achieve your goals.</b> On attempting to scribe it, it will produce shields around you and alert everyone you are attempting to scribe it; it takes a very long time to scribe, \
	and does massive damage to the one attempting to scribe it.<br>Invoking it requires 9 invokers and the sacrifice of a specific crewmember, and once invoked, will summon [ticker.mode.cultdat.entity_title3], [ticker.mode.cultdat.entity_name]. \

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Talisman of Stunning</b></font><br>Attacking a target will knock them down for a long duration in addition to inhibiting their speech. \
	Robotic lifeforms will suffer the effects of a heavy electromagnetic pulse instead.<br><br>"

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Talisman of Armaments</b></font><br>The Talisman of Arming will equip the user with armored robes, a backpack, shoes, an eldritch longsword, and an empowered bola. Any equipment that cannot \

	text += "<font color='red'><b>Soulstone</b></font><br>A soulstone is a simple piece of magic, produced either via the starter talisman or by sacrificing humans. Using it on an unconscious or dead human, or on a Shade, will trap their soul in the stone, allowing its use in construct shells. \
