SHADOWLING: A gamemode based on previously-run events

Aliens called shadowlings are on the station.
These shadowlings can 'enthrall' crew members and enslave them.
They also burn in the light but heal rapidly whilst in the dark.
The game will end under two conditions:
	1. The shadowlings die
	2. The emergency shuttle docks at CentCom

Shadowling strengths:
	- The dark
	- Hard vacuum (They are not affected by it)
	- Their thralls who are not harmed by the light
	- Stealth

Shadowling weaknesses:
	- The light
	- Fire
	- Enemy numbers
	- Lasers (Lasers are concentrated light and do more damage)
	- Flashbangs (High stun and high burn damage; if the light stuns humans, you bet your ass it'll hurt the shadowling very much!)

Shadowlings start off disguised as normal crew members, and they only have two abilities: Hatch and Enthrall.
They can still enthrall and perhaps complete their objectives in this form.
Hatch will, after a short time, cast off the human disguise and assume the shadowling's true identity.
They will then assume the normal shadowling form and gain their abilities.

The shadowling will seem OP, and that's because it kinda is. Being restricted to the dark while being alone most of the time is extremely difficult and as such the shadowling needs powerful abilities.
