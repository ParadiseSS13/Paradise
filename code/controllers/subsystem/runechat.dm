/**
  * # Runechat Subsystem
  *
  * Maintains a timer-like system to handle destruction of runechat messages. Much of this code is modeled
  * after or adapted from the timer subsystem. Made by Bobbahbrown of /tg/station13
  *
  * Note that this has the same structure for storing and queueing messages as the timer subsystem does
  * for handling timers: the bucket_list is a list of chatmessage datums, each of which are the head
  * of a circularly linked list. Any given index in bucket_list could be null, representing an empty bucket.
  *
  * AA Note:
  * One of the primary reasons for this is because each chatmessage has a timer attached to it, which is extra load on the GC
  * At 150 population, the GC literally cannot keep up with processing 368,000 runechats and 368,000 extra timers in a 1 hour 30 minute round
  * This also makes performance profiling a lot easier.
