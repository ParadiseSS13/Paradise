// Used by mapmerge2 to denote the existence of a merge conflict (or when it has to complete a "best intent" merge where it dumps the movable contents of an old key and a new key on the same tile).
// We define it explicitly here to ensure that it shows up on the highest possible plane (while giving off a verbose icon) to aide mappers in resolving these conflicts.
// DO NOT USE THIS IN NORMAL MAPPING!!! Linters WILL fail.
