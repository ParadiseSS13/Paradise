	<br>
	This guide will cover the basics on the Hi-tech Research and Development, Mining Department Experiment project.<br>
	<br>
	These grenades when used, will disperse a cloud of nanomachines into nearbye fauna, allowing a detailed examination of their body structure when alive. We will use this data to develope new products to sell, and we need your help!<br>
	<br>
	We need to see these fauna working at their full potential with the nanomachines in them, so you will have to fight them. As a warning, these nanomachines have been known to irratate and annoy animals in testing, as well injecting a cocktail of drugs into them to get their organs outputting at maximum potential.<br>
	<br>
	We operate on a limited budget, but we do provide payment for participating in this project: 0.1% of profits from any products made from this research, and medals showing off your pride for NT and promoting their research.
