Essentially what goes on here is that we have some &quot;proxy&quot; surgery steps that get inserted into existing surgeries at key points.
Depending on the tool used after that point, the proxy step chooses the next step(s) that should be executed.</p>
<p>These proxy steps use a list of surgeries, so a full procedure can be inserted into an existing surgery. Just make sure that the user's state
after an intermediate surgery is (in the context of the surgery) identical to before the intermediate surgery. Don't heal things that will
need to be healed during the surgery, for example.</p>
<p>Adding a new intermediate surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a new intermediate surgery datum with the list of steps that you want to inject. This forms one surgery &quot;branch&quot;.</li>
<li>Define a new proxy surgery step with branches containing the typepath of your new surgery datum.</li>
<li>Insert that surgery step into an existing surgery.</li>
