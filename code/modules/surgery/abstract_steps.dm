/**
 * This file consists of how we manage somewhat non-linear surgeries.
 * Essentially what goes on here is that we have some "proxy" surgery steps that get inserted into existing surgeries at key points.
 * Depending on the tool used after that point, the proxy step chooses the next step(s) that should be executed.
 *
 * These proxy steps use a list of surgeries, so a full procedure can be inserted into an existing surgery. Just make sure that the user's state
 * after an intermediate surgery is (in the context of the surgery) identical to before the intermediate surgery. Don't heal things that will
 * need to be healed during the surgery, for example.
 *
 * Adding a new intermediate surgery:
 * - Define a new intermediate surgery datum with the list of steps that you want to inject. This forms one surgery "branch".
 * - Define a new proxy surgery step with branches containing the typepath of your new surgery datum.
 * - Insert that surgery step into an existing surgery.

 * Test the next step, but don't fully commit to it unless it completes successfully.
 * If the next step doesn't fully complete (such as being interrupted or failing), we'll insert ourselves again to bring us back
 * 	to the "base" state.
 * If it does, we'll add the subsequent steps to the surgery and continue down the expected branch. If you complete the surgery step, it
 * 	means you've committed to what comes next.
 * Part of the motivation behind this is that I don't want to mutate a surgery retroactively. We can insert, but we shouldn't be changing anything
 * 	behind us.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * * next_surgery_steps - the steps for the branching surgery to add to the current surgery. If there's no branching surgery (or this would continue the main surgery) ignore this.
 * * override_adding_self - If true, then on a successful surgery, regardless of the value of insert_self_after, we won't add ourselves in as another step.
 * * readd_step_on_fail - If true, when we fail a step we'll add the failed step again after the proxy surgery. This is necessary for main surgeries.
