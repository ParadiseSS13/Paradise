<br />
To use your autochef, it must be linked to all the tools and items you want it to use.
<br />
This includes <i>machines</i> such as grills and ovens, <i>containers</i> such as grill grates and pans, and <i>storage</i> like smartfridges and food-and-drink carts.<br />
<br />
To link items to your autochef, use the autochef remote on them, and then on the autochef.<br />
<br />
<div style="width:80%;border:1px solid #000;margin:0 auto;padding:10px"><b>Pro Tip!</b> When using the remote on a machine, it will register all the containers on the machine.</div>
<br />
To choose a recipe to make, use the food item on the autochef to scan it.<br />
<br />
To start, stop, or pause the autochef, interact with it. It will continue making the selected recipe until it runs out of ingredients or cannot use the tools it needs to make it. Once a recipe is complete, the end result will be stored in any available storage.<br />
<br />
Stock autochefs require all ingredients to be prepared in advance. Once upgraded, the autochef may create items it needs to finish the selected recipe. For example, a stock autochef requires burgers and cooked patties to make burgers. An upgraded autochef can bake dough to make buns, grill patties, and then resume making the burger.<br />
<br />
<div style="width:80%;border:1px solid #000;margin:0 auto;padding:10px"><b>Pro Tip!</b> Autochefs will choose storage for output in the <i>reverse order</i> that they were linked with the remote.</div>
<br />
Autochefs may be tempermental and act in unexpected ways. If it is not working as expected:<br />
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all items it needs are linked.</li>
<li>Ensure that it has all the ingredients it needs.</li>
<li>Ensure that all machines are functional, powered, and, in the case of the grill, have enough charcoal to operate.</li>
</ul>
If all else fails, reset the autochef, scan your food item again, and restart it.
