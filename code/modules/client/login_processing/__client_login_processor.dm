/**
  * # Client Login Processor Framework
  *
  * The holder class for all client data processing
  *
  * This framework is designed for loading in client data from the database.
  * Login processors have their own queries, which will be put into one async batch and
  * executed at the same time, to reduce the time it takes for a client to login.
  * Login processors can also be given priorities to have things fire in specific orders
  * EG: Load their preferences before their job bans, etc etc
  *
  * When creating these, please name the files with the priority at the start, and the typepath after
  * EG: 10-load_preferences.dm
  * This makes it easier to track stuff down -AA07
  *
  * Also if you have used other languages before with "interface" types (Java, C# (Microsoft Java), etc),
  * treat this class as one of those. [get_query(client/C)] and [process_result(datum/db_query/Q, client/C)] MUST be overriden

  * Query Getter
  *
  * Gets the DB query for this login processor

  * Takes the client as an arg instead of just the ckey incase we need more data (IP, CID, etc).
  * Returns a DB query datum.

  * Arguments:
  * * C - The client to use to generate the query
