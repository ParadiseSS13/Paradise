//Here are the procs used to modify status effects of a mob.

// We use these to automatically apply their effects when they are changed, as
// opposed to setting them manually and having to either wait for the next `Life`
// or update by hand

// The `updating` argument is only available on effects that cause a visual/physical effect on the mob itself
// when applied, such as Stun, Weaken, and Jitter - stuff like Blindness, which has a client-side effect,
// lacks this argument.

// Ideally, code should only read the vars in this file, and not ever directly
// modify them

// If you want a mob type to ignore a given status effect, just override the corresponding
// `SetSTATE` proc - since all of the other procs are wrappers around that,
// calling them will have no effect

// BOOLEAN STATES

/*
	* EyesBlocked
		Your eyes are covered somehow
	* EarsBlocked
		Your ears are covered somehow
	* Resting
		You are lying down of your own volition
	* Flying
		For some reason or another you can move while not touching the ground

// STATUS EFFECTS
// All of these decrement over time - at a rate of 1 per life cycle unless otherwise noted
// Status effects sorted alphabetically:
/*
	*	Confused				*
			Movement is scrambled
	*	Dizzy						*
			The screen goes all warped
	*	Drowsy
			You begin to yawn, and have a chance of incrementing "Paralysis"
	*	Druggy					*
			A trippy overlay appears.
	*	Drunk						*
			Essentially what your "BAC" is - the higher it is, the more alcohol you have in you
	* EarDamage				*
			Doesn't do much, but if it's 25+, you go deaf. Heals much slower than other statuses - 0.05 normally
	*	EarDeaf					*
			You cannot hear. Prevents EarDamage from healing naturally.
	*	EyeBlind				*
			You cannot see. Prevents EyeBlurry from healing naturally.
	*	EyeBlurry				*
			A hazy overlay appears on your screen.
	*	Hallucination		*
			Your character will imagine various effects happening to them, vividly.
	*	Jitter					*
			Your character will visibly twitch. Higher values amplify the effect.
	* LoseBreath			*
			Your character is unable to breathe.
	*	Paralysis				*
			Your character is knocked out.
	* Silent					*
			Your character is unable to speak.
	*	Sleeping				*
			Your character is asleep.
	*	Slowed					*
			Your character moves slower.
	*	Slurring				*
			Your character cannot enunciate clearly.
	*	Stunned					*
			Your character is unable to move, and drops stuff in their hands. They keep standing, though.
	* Stuttering			*
			Your character stutters parts of their messages.
	*	Weakened				*
			Your character collapses, but is still conscious.
*/

// DISABILITIES
// These are more permanent than the above.
// Disabilities sorted alphabetically
/*
	*	Blind	(32)
			Can't see. EyeBlind does not heal when this is active.
	*	Coughing	(4)
			Cough occasionally, causing you to drop your items
	*	Deaf	(128)
			Can't hear. EarDeaf does not heal when this is active
	*	Epilepsy	(2)
			Occasionally go "Epileptic", causing you to become very twitchy, drop all items, and fall to the floor
	*	Mute	(64)
			Cannot talk.
	*	Nearsighted	(1)
			My glasses! I can't see without my glasses! (Nearsighted overlay when not wearing prescription eyewear)
	*	Nervous	(16)
			Occasionally begin to stutter.
	*	Tourettes	(8)
			SHIT (say bad words, and drop stuff occasionally)
