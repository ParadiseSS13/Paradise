/*

Swarmer Beacon

A strange machine appears anywhere a normal lavaland mob can it produces a swarmer at a rate of
1/15 seconds, until there are GetTotalAISwarmerCap()/2 swarmers, after this it is up to the swarmers themselves to
increase their population (it will repopulate them should they fall under GetTotalAISwarmerCap()/2 again)

tl;dr A million of the little hellraisers spawn (controlled by AI) and try to eat mining

Loot: Not much, besides a shit load of artificial bluespace crystals, Oh and mining doesn't get eaten
that's a plus I suppose.

Difficulty: Special
