	culture both feared and respected for their scientific breakthroughs. Discovery, loyalty, and utilitarianism dominates their lifestyles \
	to the degree it can cause conflict with more rigorous and strict authorities. They speak a guttural language known as 'Canilunzt' \
    which has a heavy emphasis on utilizing tail positioning and ear twitches to communicate intent."
