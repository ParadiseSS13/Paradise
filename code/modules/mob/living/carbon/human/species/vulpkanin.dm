	While Vulpkanin are chiefly led by independent planetary governments, they also serve under a loose federation known as The Assembly.<br/><br/> \
	Their religious systems traditionally pay tribute to an all-infusing universal will called 'Racht'. \
	Vulpkanin groups are minor players in galactic affairs, and are largely concerned with the focus of restoration of their homeworld."
