	species hailing from Epsilon Ursae Minoris. Each 'diona' is a cluster of numerous cat-sized organisms called nymphs; \
	there is no effective upper limit to the number that can fuse in gestalt, and reports exist	of the Epsilon Ursae \
	Minoris primary being ringed with a cloud of singing space-station-sized entities.<br/><br/>The Dionaea coexist peacefully with \
	all known species, especially the Skrell. Their communal mind makes them slow to react, and they have difficulty understanding \
	even the simplest concepts of other minds. Their alien physiology allows them survive happily off a diet of nothing but light, \
