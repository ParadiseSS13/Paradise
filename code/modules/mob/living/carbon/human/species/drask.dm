	Operating in enclaves run by elders, Drasks are biologically immortal and place great societal value in patience.<br/><br/> \
	Drask traditionally pay homage to their planet as their birth deity, with many modern Drask viewing space travel a patron saint. \
	Drasks wield little influence on the galaxy in a traditional sense and have slowly begun to become more prevalent outside their origin system thanks to alien contact."
