/// # Basic Mob
///
/// Basic mobs are a modern replacement for the simple_animal/"simple mob"
/// system. Rather than deep type trees with overrides for AI, basic mobs rely
/// on their AI controllers for the majority of their behavior.
///
/// It is also intended that as little implementation as possible be part of the
/// basic mob definition directly; rather, as much behavior as possible should
/// be delegated to components and elements, such as
/// [/datum/element/atmos_requirements] for handling reacting to atmosphere, and
/// [/datum/element/body_temperature] for handling changes in body temperature.
///
/// Migrating simple mobs to basic mobs is an incremental effort; and refactors
/// should be considered before making large changes to existing simple mob
/// code.
