	info = "Today is the day, a full month since I arrived in this dump and ive come to tolerate my bunkmate. \
	He still causes me issues with his horrid snoring and disgusting eating habits on the occasion, \
	Maybe it's the state of the facility, which can be downright filthy on some days, or perhaps it's the persistent ringing in my ears. \
	Either way, ive gotten used to it, and we even shared a donk earlier out in the field, \
	not as bad as when we first met. But better to have someone watching my back then that feeling when I first arrived. \
	The heat, the smoke, even my co-workers, makes me realize how far from home I am. \
	Wish I didnt take the hazard pay, but that decision is far past due... five more months to go before my contract is over. \
	Hopefully by the time I make it back, ill be able to see her again. \
	Just gotta keep my nerves cool and keep working, in a few months ill be back home and more secure than I ever was in Sol. \

	info = "Reports indicate a volcanic ash storm to smutter the region of our sector. Our position indicates we should be taking reduced impact from the weather, but the other sectors are having issues. \
	Sector Five, and Six in the highlands are currently undergoing possible evac from the severity. Farragus says we should shelter in place and cease operations until conditions return to normal. \
	Ive got most of the men reinforcing our structure plating, and a shipment of supplies to help us sit and and wait for the storm to pass. \
	Ashstorms have started feeling more frequent, didnt used to be this dangerous when I first got positioned to command this facility. \
	Either way, once its done, we can get back to work, ill inform Farragus about the conditions and see if we can get some geologist down here. \
