	info = "<b>Day 11 Entry</b><br><br> Thana and I have finally arrived at our cabin and are getting settled in. Thana seemed troubled upon our arrival, \
	she claims that something feels off but I'm just writing it off as nervousness. I, on the otherhand, am very excited. It has been our dream to \
	be closer to the harshness and beauty of nature and I believe this property, this new home will bring us closer to accomplishing that goal. \
	It was Thana's idea in the first place to choose a tundra of all places, something about it being the epitome of a 'transcendentalist' enviroment. \
	Even if this landscape appears to be cruel and unforgiving one can't deny the formidable beauty and power of it. While I could marvel at our surroundings \
	all day, we still have much work to do <br> <ul><li><s>Chop Firewood</s></li><li><s>Refuel ATV</s></li><li><s>unpack</s></li></ul> \

	name = "Day 23 Entry"
	info = "<b>Day 23 Entry</b><br><br> Something is wrong. There is something evil in this land. The Salmon we catch are rotted, the wildlife is rife with \
	plague, the berries cursed with blight, and the clouds hide the sun. Thana discovered something, disturbing: there appears to be an old shack that just... \
	appeared in our frontyard. Thana by her curious nature wanted to check it out but I begged her not to. It's almost as if a sense of despair is emanating \
	from it whenever I approach it. <br><br> The birds are acting strange and appear to be leaving in droves. There is a blizzard rolling in from the North so \
	we've surrendered ourselves to riding it out in our cabin until it passes, we have plenty of supplies still. However, I plan on leaving this cursed place the \
	second the weather lets up! \

	name = "Day 39 Entry"
	info = "<b>Day 39 Entry</b><br><br>  Where the fuck are we? This blizzard has been buffeting the landscape for more than a week and a half. We're running \
	dangerously low on firewood and I fear for our safety. I followed the road out of here and tried getting to our truck so I could get an emergency signal out \
	but upon reaching the perimeter of the property I ran into a massive steel wall. I followed the circumference of it a little but found no ext as it seems to go all the way in \
	a circle. The blizzard only seems to be getting stronger and I'm certain that our windows will soon give way to the wind; Me and Thana have decided to \
	take shelter in our back room, it's a bit colder there but its protected from the wind and snow atleast. \

	name = "Day 41 Entry"
	info = "<i>the paper is soaked with blood and appears to have been written very hastily</i> \
	<br><br><b>Day 41 Entry</b><br><br> help us please. The air is cold and so dry I can barely speak. I don't know where Thana is, she was whispering herself \
	in the corner. Something about needing to be somewhere. Sometime between then and now she left, I'm too tired to go after her. I feel as though I'm being \
	tortured by some ancient power. And this incesant buzzing! I can't get it out of my head! It started a few days ago and it just seems to be getting louder, \
	it's thunderous in my head and I can't even think straight, I don't know how much longer I can take this. Wait, I think I can hear someone coming. I think Thana has returned- \
	<br><br><i>the writing ends abrubtly and trails off with inlegible scribbles.</i>"

	name = "Thana's Departure"
	info = "I left my husband alone, I cannot resolve myself to dying curled up in my coffin that I call a home grasping for long departed warmth. It beckons me \
	the voice in my head, it calls itself Ijiraat. I'm not sure what it wants. I walked from our porch out into the great white cacophony of snow stripping me \
	of what body heat I still had left. As I approached the shack a crow with beady red eyes appeared in front of me. It stared at me, almost as if it was looking \
	through me, into my soul. At that moment I knew what I needed to do. The shack loomed in the distance, feelings of terror were replaced with comfort and relief. \
	Inside was an altar with what appeared to be a bone knife. I grabbed it and headed back to the cabin. <br><br> Pana didn't want to come at first but with a little \
	bit of <i>encouragement</i> he eventually capitulated and was removed from the recesses of our cabin. I brought him before the altar and the rest took care of itself \
	The blizzard ceased and serenity was restored to our new metal home. We weren't cold anymore; Our love was eternal."
