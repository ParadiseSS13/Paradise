## SECURITY NOTES

Alkkus got into a fight with Tikka again. We aren't sure what provoked them, but Alkkus calmed down \
 after temporary admonition. Askkith is upset it didn't escalate, but I'm just glad no weapons were drawn. \
 Tikka had to report to Altus for a checkup, suffering a few bruises to the side of their head. Even still, \
 Tikka chose to forgive Alkkus. I can't stand him, Alkkus has been nothing but trouble from the moment they got here."}))
