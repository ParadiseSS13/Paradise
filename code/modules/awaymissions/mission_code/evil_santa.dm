			Every year, coal in my stockings when this stupid holiday comes around.<br> \
			Not this year though. This year will be different. I'm going to find that fat man, I swear.<br> \
			He'll have to give me all the good presents, if he wants to live long enough to get any cookies."

			The elves and village are a lie though. Not sure where the toys come from yet, but I'll get them.<br> \
			Not much out here, a couple little shacks and a big igloo in the center... Bet he's inside that.<br> \
			On an unrelated note, great packing snow. Built a snowman today."

			Not even my Syndicate training was a match for him. Barely made it out with my life.<br> \
			He was just waiting for me... He knew. He was ready.<br> \
			Couldn't make it back to my shack. That gun would have helped, if only I brought it...<br> \
			Cave-in has me trapped in here, I just hope the distress signal reaches help in time... <br> \

			He knows. He knows. He knows. He knows. He knows. He knows. He knows. He knows. He knows."
