#define NITROGEN_RETARDATION_FACTOR 2        //Higher == N2 slows reaction more
#define THERMAL_RELEASE_MODIFIER 5                //Higher == less heat released during reaction
#define PLASMA_RELEASE_MODIFIER 750                //Higher == less plasma released by reaction
#define OXYGEN_RELEASE_MODIFIER 325        //Higher == less oxygen released at high temperature/power
#define REACTION_POWER_MODIFIER 0.55                //Higher == more overall power
