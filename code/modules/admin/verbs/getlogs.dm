/*
	HOW DO I LOG RUNTIMES?
	Firstly, start dreamdeamon if it isn't already running. Then select "world>Log Session" (or press the F3 key)
	navigate the popup window to the data/logs/runtime/ folder from where your tgstation .dmb is located.
	(you may have to make this folder yourself)

	OPTIONAL: 	you can select the little checkbox down the bottom to make dreamdeamon save the log everytime you
				start a world. Just remember to repeat these steps with a new name when you update to a new revision!

	Save it with the name of the revision your server uses (e.g. r3459.txt).
	Game Masters will now be able to grant access any runtime logs you have archived this way!
	This will allow us to gather information on bugs across multiple servers and make maintaining the TG
	codebase for the entire /TG/station commuity a TONNE easier :3 Thanks for your help!
