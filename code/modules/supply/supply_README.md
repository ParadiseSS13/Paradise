## IMPORTANT SUPPLY PACKS NOTES

### Pack Parameters
* only secure crate types use the access var (and are lockable)
* hidden packs only show up when the computer has been hacked.
* Contraband is obtainable through modified supplycomp circuitboards.

### Bug Prevention
* Don't add living things to crates, that's bad, it will break the shuttle.
* Do NOT set the price of any crates below 7 points. Doing so allows infinite points.

### Pack Organization
* Anytime a supply pack is ordered, it needs to be put in the dm file that matches its type
* Anytime a supply pack category becomes overloaded (think 20+ packs) you should consider splitting it into multiple categories
* Avoid throwing things in the miscellanious category unless it really doesn't have a place elsewhere
