# Add a system to let us give arbitrary amounts of space
## Divide space into 4 repeatedly until we get a nice chunk
## I am NOT handling concave chunks - rectangles only

# Allow the map transition code to add z levels without radically altering structure - DONE!

# Make sure people can't teleport while in our pocket dimensions
## Maybe add flags or similar, as an option for each requested chunk

# Give credit to https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/12370 for the
# map transition update

# Tie various systems into the z level manager
# Search for terms like:
## ZLEVEL_CENTCOMM
## ZLEVEL_STATION
## config.station_levels
