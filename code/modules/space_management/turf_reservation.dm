/*
 * Turf reservations are used to reserve specific areas of the reserved z-levels for various purposes, typically for late-loading maps.
 * It ensures that reserved turfs are properly managed and can be released when no longer needed.
 * Reservations are not automatically released, so they must be manually released when no longer needed.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - To create a new reservation, call the `request_turf_block_reservation(width, height)` method from the mapping subsystem.
 * - This will return a new instance of /datum/turf_reservation if the reservation is successful.
 *
 * Releasing:
 * - Call the `Release` method on the /datum/turf_reservation instance to release the reserved turfs and cordon turfs.
 * - This will return the used turfs to the mapping subsystem to allow for reuse of the turfs.
