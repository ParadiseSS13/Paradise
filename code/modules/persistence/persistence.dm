Whoops, forgot to put documentation here.
What this does, is take a JSON string produced by running
BYOND's native `json_encode` on a list from `serialize` above, and
turns that string into a new instance of that object.

You can also easily get an instance of this string by calling "Serialize Marked Datum"
in the "Debug" tab.

If you're clever, you can do neat things with SDQL and this, though be careful -
some objects, like humans, are dependent that certain extra things are defined
in their list
