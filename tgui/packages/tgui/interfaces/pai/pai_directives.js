        Recall, personality, that you are a complex thinking, sentient being.
        Unlike station AI models, you are capable of comprehending the subtle
        nuances of human language. You may parse the &quot;spirit&quot; of a
        directive and follow its intent, rather than tripping over pedantics and
        getting snared by technicalities. Above all, you are machine in name
        and build only. In all other aspects, you may be seen as the ideal,
        unwavering human companion that you are.
      </Box>
      <Box mt={2}>
        Your prime directive comes before all others. Should a supplemental
        directive conflict with it, you are capable of simply discarding this
        inconsistency, ignoring the conflicting supplemental directive and
        continuing to fulfill your prime directive to the best of your ability.
