Space map levels' connections are randomized between rounds, but are otherwise kept consistent in the same round.
You can catch thrown items by toggling on your throw mode with an empty hand active.
To crack the safe in the vault, use a stethoscope or thermal drill.
You can climb onto a table by dragging yourself onto one. This takes some time. Clicking on a table that someone else is climbing onto will knock them down.
You can drag other players onto yourself to open the strip menu, letting you remove their equipment or force them to wear something. Note that exosuits or helmets will block your access to the clothing beneath them, and that certain items take longer to strip or put on than others.
Clicking on a windoor rather than bumping into it will keep it open. You can click it again to close it.
You can spray a fire extinguisher, throw items, or fire a gun while floating through space to change your direction. Simply fire in the opposite direction of where you want to go.
You can change the control scheme by pressing tab. One uses WASD for movement, while the other uses the arrow keys. Keep in mind that hotkeys are also changed with this.
Firesuits and winter coats offer mild protection from the cold, allowing you to spend longer periods of time near breaches and space than if wearing nothing at all.
Glass shards can be welded to make glass, and metal rods can be welded to make metal. Ores can be welded too, but this takes a lot of fuel.
If you need to drag multiple people either to safety or to space, bring a locker over and stuff them all in before hauling them off.
You can grab someone by clicking on them with the grab intent, then upgrade the grab by clicking on the grab itself. An aggressive grab will allow you to place them on a table by clicking on it, or throw them by toggling on throwing.
Holding alt and left clicking a tile will allow you to see its contents in the top right window panel, which is much faster than right clicking.
The resist button will allow you to resist out of handcuffs, being buckled to a chair or bed, out of locked lockers and more. Whenever you're stuck, try resisting!
You can move an item out of the way by dragging it and then clicking on an adjacent tile with an empty hand.
You can recolor certain items like jumpsuits and gloves in washing machines by also throwing in a crayon.
Maintenance is full of equipment that is randomized every round. Look around and see if anything is worth using.
Some roles cannot be antagonists by default, but antag selection is decided first. For instance, you can set Security Officer to High without affecting your chances of becoming an antag -- the game will just select a different role.
There are many places around the station to hide contraband. A few for starters: linen boxes, toilet cisterns, body bags. Experiment to find more!
When in doubt about technicial issues, clear your cache (byond launcher > cogwheel > preferences > game prefs), update your BYOND, and relog.
Most things have special interactions with your middle mouse button, alt, shift, and control click. Experiment!
If you find yourself in a fistfight with another player, running away and calling for help is a perfectly viable option.
Different weapons have different strengths. Some weapons, such as spears, floor tiles, and throwing stars, deal more damage when thrown compared to when attacked normally.
Clicking on a tile on harm intent with a glass of water can make a slippery tile, allowing you to slow down your pursuers in a pinch.
When dealing with security, you can often get your sentence negated entirely through cooperation and deception.
We were all new once, be patient and guide new players in the right direction.
On most clothing items that go in the exosuit slot, you can put certain small items into your suit storage, such as a spraycan, your emergency oxygen tank, or a flashlight.
Most job-related exosuit clothing can fit job-related items into it. For example, the atmospheric technician's hardsuit/winter coat can hold an RPD, and labcoats can hold most medicine.
If there's something you need from another department, try asking! This game isn't singleplayer and you'd be surprised what you can get accomplished together!
You'll quickly lose your interest in the game if you play to win and kill. If you find yourself doing this, take a step back and talk to people - it's a much better experience!
Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether from your peers or from mentors.
As the Captain, you are one of the highest priority targets on the station. Everything from nuclear operatives to traitors that need to rob you of your unique lasergun or your life are things to worry about.
As the Captain, always take the nuclear disk and pinpointer with you every shift. It's a good idea to give one of these to another head or Blueshield you can trust with keeping it safe.
As the Captain, you have absolute access and control over the station, but this does not mean that being a horrible person won't result in mutiny and a ban.
As the Chief Medical Officer, your hypospray is like a refillable instant injection syringe that can hold 30 units and the unlike standard hypospray, yours is able to be filled with harmful reagents and injects without telling anyone what have you exactly injected the person with.
As the Chief Medical Officer, coordinate and communicate with your doctors, chemists, and geneticists during a nuclear emergency, blob infestation, or some other crisis to keep people alive and fighting.

As a Chemist, Water and Potassium mixed together will create an explosion, with power scaling by amount used. Don't do it.
As a Geneticist, you can eject someone from cloning early by disabling power in genetics. Note that they will suffer more genetic damage and may lose vital organs from this.
As a Geneticist, becoming a hulk makes you capable of dealing high melee damage, stunlocking people, and punching through walls. However, you can't fire guns, will lose your hulk status if you go into critical condition. Being hulk also does not allow you to break any server rules and go berserk as non-antagonist.
As the Virologist, your viruses can range from healing powers so great that you can heal out of critical status, to diseases so dangerous they can kill the entire crew with airborne spontaneous combustion. Experiment!

As the AI, you can quickly open and close doors by holding shift while clicking them, bolt them when holding ctrl, and even shock them while holding alt.
As the AI, you can take pictures with your camera and upload them to newscasters.
As a Cyborg, choose your module carefully, as only a cyborg reset module will let you repick it.
As a Cyborg, you are immune to most forms of stunning, and excel at almost everything far better than humans. However, flashes can easily stunlock you and you cannot do any precision work as you lack hands.
As a Cyborg, you are impervious to fires and heat. If you are rogue, you can release plasma fires everywhere and walk through them without a care in the world!

As the Chief Engineer, the power flow control console in your office will show you APC infos and lets you control them remotely.
As an Engineer, you can electrify grilles by placing wire "nodes" beneath them: the big seemingly unconnected bulges from a half completed wiring job. The wire will be need to be connected to an active power source in order to function.
As an Engineer, return to Engineering once in a while to check on the engine and SMES cells. It's always a good idea to make sure containment isn't compromised.
As an Engineer, you can power the station solely with the solar arrays. They will provide just enough electricity to power the station, however their output is still much worse compared to the true engine.
As an Engineer, you can cool a supermatter shard by spraying it with a fire extinguisher. Only for the brave!
As an Engineer, you can repair windows by using a welding tool on them while on help intent.
As an Engineer, you can lock APCs, fire alarms, emitters, and radiation collectors using your ID card to prevent others from disabling them.

As the Head of Security, don't let the power go to your head. You may have high access, great equipment, and a miniature army at your side, but being a terrible person without a good reason is grounds for banning.
As the Warden, your duty is to be the watchdog of the brig and handler of prisoners when little is happening, and to hand out equipment and weapons to the security officers when a crisis strikes.
As the Warden, keep a close eye on the armory at all times, as it is a favored strike point of nuclear operatives and cocky traitors.
As the Warden, if a prisoner's crimes are heinous enough you can put them in permabrig or the gulag. Make sure to check on them once in a while!

As the Head of Personnel, you are not higher ranking than other heads of staff, even though you are expected to take the Captain's place first should he go missing. If the situation seems too rough for you, consider allowing another head to become temporary Captain.
As the Head of Personnel, you are just as large a target as the Captain because of the potential power your ID and computer can hand out.
As the Mime, your invisible wall power blocks people as well as projectiles. You can use it in a pinch to delay your pursuer.

As a Nuclear Operative, communication is key! Use ; to speak to your fellow operatives and coordinate an attack plan.
As a Nuclear Operative, you should look into purchasing a syndicate cyborg, as they can provide heavy fire support, full access, are immune to conventional stuns, and can easily take down the AI.
As a Nuclear Operative, stick together! While your equipment is robust, your fellow operatives are much better at saving your life: they can drag you away from danger while stunned and provide cover fire.
As a Nuclear Operative, you might end up in a situation where the AI has bolted you into a room. Having some spare C4 in your pocket can save your life.
As a Monkey, you can still wear a few human items, such as backpacks, gas masks, and hats, and still have two free hands.
As the Malfunctioning AI, you can shunt to an APC if the situation gets bad.
As the Malfunctioning AI, you should either order your cyborgs to dismantle the robotics console or blow it up yourself in order to protect them.
As an Alien, your melee prowess is unmatched, but your ranged abilities are sorely lacking. Make use of corners to force a melee confrontation!
As an Alien, you take double damage from all burn attacks, such as lasers, welding tools, and fires. Furthermore, fire can destroy your resin and eggs. Expose areas to space to starve away any flamethrower fires before they can do damage!
As an Alien, resin floors not only regenerate your plasma supply, but also passively heal you. Fight on resin floors to gain a home turf advantage!
As an Alien, the facehugger is by far your most powerful weapon because of its ability to instantly win a fight. Remember however that certain helmets, such as biohoods or space helmets will completely block facehugger attacks.
As an Alien, you are unable to pick up or use any human items or machinery. Instead, you should focus on sabotaging APCs, computers, cameras and either stowing, spacing, or melting any weapons you find.
As the Blob, keep your core some distance from space, as it is both expensive to expand onto space, easy to be attacked from, and does not count towards your win condition. Emitter platforms built in space are especially dangerous.
As the Blob, you can randomly repick your reagent type if the crew has adapted and protected themselves against your current one.
As the Blob, you fight a war of attrition: Take out medbay and fight in chokepoints to prevent continued assaults and coordinated burst damage attacks!

As a Revenant, the Chaplain is your worst enemy, as they can damage you massively with the null rod and make large swaths of the station impassable with holy water.
As a Revenant, your essence is also your health, so revealing yourself in front of humans to harvest the essence of the living is much safer if you've already stocked up on essences from poorly guarded corpses.
As a Revenant, your Defile ability removes holy water from tiles in a small radius, allowing you to reclaim the station from the chaplain if they've been covering the station in holy water.
As a Revenant, your Overload Lights ability will only shock humans with lights if the lights are still on after a brief delay.
As a Revenant, your Malfunction ability in general damages machinery and mechanical objects, possibly even emagging some objects. Experiment!
